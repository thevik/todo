## just a basic todo app

This is just a basic todo app made with html, css and vanilla js, I dont think you can ofc contribute anything lmao.

-- one click on the todo to make it mark as completed
-- double click to delete the todo

your all todo will be wooped (removed) when refreshed, I dont got a database
